This websites are built to connect shoppers to products or services for trading online. It's provide everything we need for online shopping, including product listings, prices, shopping carts, wholesale price, and checkout processes.

* Shopping cart: The shopping cart can make the buying of multiple items on eBay much easier since you can pay for all of them with a single click-through at the end of the purchase process.

* eBay Advanced Search: On the far right of the search box on eBay’s home page is the Advanced link. Click it to view an eBay search box that enables searches by location, price range, buying format, number of bids, currency of sale, and much, much more.

* Search criteria refinement: After you’ve run a keyword search on eBay, you can refine what eBay is helping you to look for using the links and options down the left side of your screen.

* Products and reviews via the eBay catalog: After you’ve run an eBay search, use the “Products & Reviews” tab at the top of the search results list to show your results as a series of products (by make and model) and their user reviews, rather than as a series of individual listings.

* eBay wish list: Like an Amazon wish list, an eBay wish list is a place where you can gather together a list of things you’d like to own.

* Favorites: You can add items to your favorites list by clicking the heart icon on the item’s listing page. This makes it easy to keep track of items you’re interested in.

* Report item: If you see an item on eBay that you believe is fraudulent or violates eBay’s policies, you can report it to eBay by clicking the “Report item” link on the item’s listing page.
